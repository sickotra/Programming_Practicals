# Programming_Module_Practicals

over these practicals we're going to build up a model that:

1) builds a series of agents in space
2) each agent will have a list of the other agents so they can communicate
3) each agent will know about the environment it is in and be able to query/change the environment
4) agents will move around the environment eating it, but checking first that other agents aren't already in the neighbourhood
the environment will contain data from a file
5) we'll display the environment and other data after the model has run
6) we'll be able to save the environment as results of the model
